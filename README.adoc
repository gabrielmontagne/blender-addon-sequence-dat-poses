= Minimalist .dat pose application
:revnumber: 0.0.1

â˜…

Create or load or link a pose library for which each pose is named like the position in the .dat file.
Run the operator `animation.dat_sequence_animation` and selec your `.dat` file.
This will auto-key in the poses on the corresponding frames.

This is a hyperminimalist version of the famous "lip sync addon" with zero bells and zero whistles.
Maybe just one.
